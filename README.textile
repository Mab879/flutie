h1. Flutie

Basic, default styles for rails applications

h2. Installation

Flutie is a Rails engine. It works with versions of Rails greater than 2.3.

Flutie is recommended to be run as a plugin so that the automatic installer is run.

script/plugin install git@github.com:thoughtbot/flutie.git

The installer will copy the Flutie stylesheets into public/flutie/stylesheets

Once Flutie is installed, with your application running (not in production environment) you can browse to /styleguide.  This will present you will many standard markup elements that are present in a rails application, in your default application layout.

Click on the "Default styles" link to view the same markup with a barebones layout that only contains the Flutie stylesheets. Click on "Application styles" to view the markup in your application layout.

h2. Gem Installation

You can also install Flutie as a gem, but then you'll need to run the install task manually.

In config/environment.rb:

<pre>
config.gem "thoughtbot-flutie", 
  :lib     => 'clearance', 
  :source  => 'http://gems.github.com', 
  :version => '1.0.0'
</pre>

Vendor the gem:

<pre>
rake gems:install
rake gems:unpack
</pre>

Run the installer:

<pre>
ruby vendor/gems/thoughtbot-flutie-1.0.0/install.rb
</pre>
