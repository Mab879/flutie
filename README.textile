Basic, default styles for rails applications

h2. Installation

Flutie is a Rails engine. It works with versions of Rails greater than 2.3.

Flutie is recommended to be run as a plugin so that the automatic installer is run.

script/plugin install 

The installer will copy the flutie stylesheets into public/flutie/stylesheets

Once Flutie is installed, with your application running (not in production environment) you can browse to /styleguide.  This will present you will many standard markup elements that are present in rails application, in your default application layout.

Click on the "Default styles" link to view the same markup with a barebones layout that only contains the flutie stylesheets. Click on "Application styles" to view the markup in your application layout.

In config/environment.rb:

<pre>
config.gem "thoughtbot-flutie", 
  :lib     => 'clearance', 
  :source  => 'http://gems.github.com', 
  :version => '1.0.0'
</pre>

Vendor the gem:

<pre>
rake gems:install
rake gems:unpack
</pre>
